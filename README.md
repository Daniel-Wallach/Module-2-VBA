## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

- The ticker symbol

- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

- The total stock volume of the stock.

- Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

- Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

-  Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
